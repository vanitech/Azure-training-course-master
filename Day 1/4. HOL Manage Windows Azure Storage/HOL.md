### Excercise 1: Use Azure Storage Explorer to manage your storage accounts.  ###

Azure Storage Explorer is a useful GUI tool for inspecting and altering the data in your Windows Azure Storage storage projects including the logs of your cloud-hosted applications. All 3 types of cloud storage can be viewed and edited: blobs, queues, and tables. 

1. Azure Storage Explorer can be downloaded for free from [CodePlex](http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/). 

	![Azure Storage Explorer Page](images/azure-storage-explorer-page.png)

	_Azure Storage Explorer Page_

    The latest version is 5.0 Preview, but you can also download the previous released version.

1. Download *Azure Storage Explorer 4* or better and install it.

	> The Azure Storage Explorer can only be installed on Windows machines.

	![Install Azure Storage Explorer](images/install-azure-storage-explorer.png)

	_Install Azure Storage Explorer_

1. Before you launch the tool, you need to know your storage account's name add access key. You can find your storage account name and acess key in your Windows Azure Management Portal.

	![Windows Azure Storage Account](images/wa-storage-account.png)

	_Windows Azure Storage Account_
	
	Click the "Manage Access Keys" button under the page to display the storage account name and access keys for the currently selected storage account. 

	![Manage Access Key](images/manage-access-key.png)

	_Manage Access Key_	

	>If there is no storage account under your subscription, you can just click **New** -> **Data Service** -> **Storage** -> **Quick Create** to create one.
	>
	>![Create A Storage Account](images/create-a-storage-account.png)
	>
	>_Create A Storage Account_	

1. Launch *Azure Storage Explorer*.
	
	![Azure Storage Expolor](images/azure-storage-explorer-main.png)

	_Azure Storage Expolor_

1. Then Click "Add Account" button on the top and input your account name and access key in the form, check the **Use HTTPS** and click "Add Storage Account".

	![Add Account Information](images/add-account-info.png)

	_Add Account Information_	

1. A new form will pop up to notify you it takes some time to scan the storage account if it is the first time you add the storage account. Click OK and after several seconds Azure Storage Explorer will be ready to help you viewing the blob, table and queue data in your storage account. 

	![New Storage Account Confirmation](images/aze-new-storage-account.png)

	_New Storage Account Confirmation_

	![Manage Storage Account](images/aze-manage-storage-account.png)

	_Manage Storage Account_

	Azure Storage Explorer displays information about Blob storage by default. From here, you can create, copy, rename or delete a container with the button on left top. Now let's create a sample container and upload a file to your storage account.

1. Click *New*, input the container name *samplecontainer* and set the *Accessibility* to be *Public Container*. Click *Create Container* and you will create a new container under the storage account. The "Public Container" means that everyone can access the file through its fully qualified URL (via http or https). If you don't want anyone knowing your URLs to be able to access files in the container, set the accessibility to be private instead of public.
	
	![New Container](images/aze-new-container.png)

	![New Container](images/aze-new-container-2.png)

	![New Container](images/aze-new-container-3.png)

	_New Container_

1. Next, we will upload a new file to the new container. Click the new container on the left and click *Upload* button on the top.

	![Upload File](images/aze-upload-file.png)
	
	_Upload File_

1. You can locate any files on your drives. We have some sample files under **Source\Exercise1\** which you can upload. Please make sure you upload the file **cut_diamonds.csv** which will be used [Exercise 2](#Exercise2)

	![Uploaded Files](images/aze-upload-file-finished.png)
	
	_Uploaded Files_

	Files stored in the Blob Storage Service can simply referred to as blobs. You can see basic information about the blob such as its name, when last modified, length and content type. Each storage account in Windows Azure can hold up to 200TB which could consist of many large blobs, or even one 200GB blob.

1. Double click the file **Sample.txt** and you will find more information. You can find the properties and metadata. Since the file is a text file, Azure Storage Explorer displays its contents.

	![File Property](images/aze-file-properties.png)

	_File Property_

	![File Metadata](images/aze-file-metadata.png)

	_File Metadata_

	![File Text](images/aze-file-text.png)

	_The Content of a File_
	
1. On the top right side, you can also manage the Windows Azure Table and Queue data in your storage account. With Tables, you can add or remove entities along with other Table management features. With Queues, you can push and pop messages along with other Queue management features. For more instructions on interacting with Queue and Table data using Azure Storage Explorer, you can visit [AzureStorageExplorer4UserGuide.pdf](http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=azurestorageexplorer&DownloadId=160664).

### Excercise 2: Use IPython notebook to run storage commands.  ###
Use the IPython notebook  you have already created in the previous exercise **Using Windows Azure Virtual Machines.** for this exercise. You can manage Windows Azure Storage Account in IPython. 

>Note: If you have not completed the Virtual Machines lab, please note that IPython notebook is an interactive Python framework which makes Python project development and management much more easier. 

>Build an IPython environment on windows azure, you can read  [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/tutorials/ipython-notebook/](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/python/tutorials/ipython-notebook/)

After the IPython Notebook is deployed, you can open the IPython Notebook in your Explorer:

![IPython Notebook](images/ipython_notebook_main.png)

_IPython Notebook_

1. Create the button **New Notebook** on the top right, 

	![Create a New Notebook](images/ipn-new-notebook.png)

	![Create a New Notebook](images/ipn-untitled-notebook.png)

	_Create a New Notebook_

1. Next we are going to go use some Python code to manage the storage account that we created in Azure Storage Explorer. Open the file **Source\Exercise2\IPythonStorageManager.py** in a text editor and we will execute those commands step by step.

	![IPythonStorageManager Code](images/ipn-code-in-vs.png)

	_IPythonStorageManager Code_

1. First we need to set the *account* and *key* variable in the code. We've just learnt how to get those information from Windows Azure Management Portal in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1). Then we will run those code in IPython Notebook.

1. Excute the following code to imports all required libraries.

	<pre>
	#first we import modules we require
	from azure.storage import *
	import os
	import csv
	import numpy
	from collections import defaultdict
	import time
	</pre>

	![Import Libraries](images/ipy-code-import.png)

	_Import Libraries_

1. Then we set the private variables for the storage account

	<pre>
	#put your account name and key here
	account = '[Your Storage Account Name]'
	key = '[You Storage Accunt Access Key]'		
	containername = 'samplecontainer'
	</pre>
	![Set Variables](images/ipy-code-key.png)

	_Set Variables_

1. We create a BlobService to manage all blobs in the storage account 

	<pre>
	#get a handle to your account
	blob_service = BlobService(account_name=account, account_key=key)
	</pre>
	![Create Blob Service](images/ipy-code-blob-service.png)

	_Create Blob Service_

1. Now we will list all blobs in the current storage account and container.We will print all blobs' name and full urls. 

	<pre>
	#list all blobs of the container
	blobs = blob_service.list_blobs(containername)
	for blob in blobs:
	    print(blob.name)
	    print(blob.url)
    </pre>

	![List All Blobs](images/ipy-code-list-blobs.png)

	_List All Blobs_

	You can see that we get all files that we uploaded to the container in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

1. Next we are going to create a new file locally and upload the file to my storage account. We create a text file *sample2.txt* and then write *This is another sample* into it.

	<pre>
	#create a new file a blob into a container
	open(r'sample2.txt', 'w').write("This is another sample")		
	#upload the blob into the container
	sampleblob2 = open(r'sample2.txt', 'r').read()
	blob_service.put_blob(containername, 'sample2.txt', sampleblob2, x_ms_blob_type='BlockBlob')		
     </pre>

	![Upload Blob](images/ipy-code-upload-blob.png)

	_Upload Blob_

	When the upload is done, we launch Azure Storage Explorer again and refresh current container. We can see a new file *Sample2.txt" appears in the container.

	![The Sample2.txt is Uploaded](images/aze-refresh-upload-blob.png)

	_The Sample2.txt is Uploaded_

1. We can also delete the file in the container by following code.

	<pre>
	#then we can remove sample2.txt
	os.remove(r'sample2.txt')
	#delete the blob remotely
	blob_service.delete_blob(containername, 'sample2.txt')
	#check the azure storage explorer again, the file is removed.	
     </pre>

	![Delete Blob](images/ipy-code-delete-blob.png)

	_Delete Blob_

	Again, in the Azure Storage Explorer again and refresh current container. We can see the file *Sample2.txt" disappears.

	![The Sample2.txt is Deleted](images/aze-refresh-delete-blob.png)

	_The Sample2.txt is Deleted_

1. The let's download the csv file to local and we can draw a scatter figure from the data.

	<pre>
	#we can also download a csv file to local
	csv_file = 'cut_diamonds.csv'
	csvblob = blob_service.get_blob(containername, csv_file)
	with open(csv_file, 'w') as f:
    	f.write(csvblob)	
     </pre>

	![Download Blob](images/ipy-code-download-blob.png)

	_Download Blob_

1. Then we load the data in csv from the csv library and draw a scatter plot based on its carat and price.


	<pre>
	#then we draw a scatter from the csvfile
	columns = defaultdict(list) #we want a list to append each value in each column to
	with open(csv_file) as f:
	    reader = csv.DictReader(f) #create a reader which represents rows in a dictionary form
	    for row in reader: #this will read a row as {column1: value1, column2: value2,...}
	        for (k,v) in row.items(): #go over each column name and value 
	            columns[k].append(v) #append the value into the appropriate list based on column name k
	carat = np.array(columns['Carat'])
	price = np.array(columns['Price'])
	scatter(carat,price,marker ='o',color='#ff0000')
     </pre>

	![Scatter](images/ipy-code-scatter.png)

	_The carat and price scatter diagram_

1. Next we will also manage some table storage operation. Windows Azure Table storage is used to save many entities with different partition key and row key. It can be used as a NoSQL storage repository. First we are going to create a TableService object with the same account name and key name. We will also set the private variable to save a table name.

	<pre>
	#Next we are going to demostrate the table storage management in Windows Azure
	#we can add top 100 rows of the cut_diamond csv to a table storage
	#get a handle to your account
	table_service = TableService(account_name=account, account_key=key)
	table_name = 'diamondtable';
     </pre>

	![TableService](images/ipy-code-table-service.png)

	_Create Table Service_

1. Then we create a new table. First we will delete the table in case the table exists.
		

	<pre>
	#delete the table for temporary data
	result = table_service.delete_table(table_name)		
	# create a new table to save all entities.
	result = table_service.create_table(table_name)	
     </pre>

	![Create New Table](images/ipy-code-create-new-table.png)

	_Create New Table_

	We goto the Azure Storage Explorer again, click *Tables* and check the new table.

	![New Table is Created](images/aze-create-new-table.png)

	_New Table is Created_

1. Now we will create 100 top entities and insert those entities into the new table. We will set each entity's partition key to be the diamond's color and row key is the index.

	<pre>
	#then we insert the top 100 diamond into the table, we set PartitionKey to be each diamonds' color and RowKey to be the index
	index = 0
	with open(csv_file) as f:
	    reader = csv.DictReader(f) #create a reader which represents rows in a dictionary form
	    for row in reader: #this will read a row as {column1: value1, column2: value2,...}
	        entity = Entity()
	        entity.PartitionKey = row['Color']
	        entity.RowKey= str(index)
	        entity.Clarity = row['Clarity']
	        entity.Cut = row['Cut']
	        entity.Carat = row['Carat']
	        entity.Price = row['Price']
	        table_service.insert_entity(table_name, entity)
	        print row
	        index=index+1
	        if index >= 100:
	            break
	#we can check the azure storage explore to query all entities that we inserted.	
     </pre>

	![Insert Entities](images/ipy-code-insert-entities.png)

	_Insert Entities_

	In the Azure Storage Explorer, click *Query* button and you will find all entities are inserted.

	![Entities Are Inserted](images/aze-insert-entities.png)

	_Entities Are Inserted_

1. We are also perform query against the table. Now we want to get all diamonds information with D color. The code is followed:

	<pre>
	#we can also query all table entities with diamonds' color = 'D'
	diamonds = table_service.query_entities(table_name, "PartitionKey eq 'D'")
	for d in diamonds:
    	print(str(d.Cut),str(d.PartitionKey),str(d.Clarity),str(d.Carat),'$'+ str(d.Price))
    </pre>

	![Query Table](images/ipy-code-query-table.png)

	_Query Table_

Now we finished all operations. We can easily use IPython Notebook to manage all storage account on Windows Azure.

### Excercise 3 (Optional): Use AzCopy to Copy files between different storage accounts.  ###

AzCopy is another tool to manage azure storage account. It can be used to copy files from local to remote storage account or even between different storage accounts. For more inforamtion, please refer to [Windows Azure Storage Team Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx).

1. AzCopy.exe is distributed as .NET assemblies, we can download the [CTP2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=287086) version and extract to a local folder. It is a command line tool.

1. Create a new storage account under your subscription on Windows Azure Management Portal. Set the storage account name to a different name.

	![Create A New Storage Account](images/create-another-storage-account.png)

	_Create A New Storage Account_

1. Save its access key from the portal.

	![Get Another Storage Account Access Key](images/get-another-storage-account-key.png)

	_Get Another Storage Account Access Key_

1. Add the storage account to Azure Storage Explorer again and create a new container in the new storage account.

	![Create A New Container](images/aze-create-new-container.png)

	_Create A New Container_

1. Then we want to use AzCopy to copy all files from the old container to the new container. Execute the following command in commnad line:

	<pre>
		AzCopy https://<sourceaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<sourcecontainer>/ https://<destaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<destcontainer>/  /sourcekey:<key> /destkey:<key> /S
	</pre>

	Replace all fields according to your configuration. The above command will copy all blobs from the container named "sourcecontainer" in storage account "sourceaccount" to another container named "destcontainer" in storage account "destaccount".

	
	![AzCopy Between Storage Accounts](images/azcopy-copy-between-storage-account.png)

	_AzCopy Between Storage Accounts_

	Let's go to the Azure Storage Explorer again and you will find all files are copied to the new container.

	![Check Result in Azure Storage Explorer](images/aze-azcopy-container.png)

	_Check Result in Azure Storage Explorer_


AzCopy also support many other features like move, snapshot and multiple network calls. For more details, please refer to the AzCopy [page](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2013/04/01/azcopy-using-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx).
